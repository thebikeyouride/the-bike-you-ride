  <p><em>Saturday 7 June 2025, Edinburgh</em></p>

      <p>I just got back from a ride with what I think are two great ideas. The ride itself was also a great idea. I was sitting around the flat, slightly hungover, looking at the rain and feeling sorry for myself. I was thinking about a ride I could do tomorrow when its a bit drier, but I just thought fuck it lets do it now. There’s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing as they say. Turns out the weather wasn’t even that bad, I didn’t even need my rain jacket. I rode to South Queensferry, grabbed a coffee and a pistachio brownie and looked at the Forth for a bit. Already my day had been made. On the ride out I went the Dalmeny estate way, which had some good gravel. I decided to take the road way back, so had a bit more brain space to think.</p>

<p>I realised how much joy I was getting out my £70 90s mountain bike, and I started to wonder how far it could take me. Could I ride 100 km on it? What about further? What would I need to do to prepare for such a ride? And just like that I could feel my brain latching onto a new challenge. I’m just off the back of the Dearg Up N Doon trail race, and I’m thinking maybe a marathon in the Autumn or winter, so a summer training for a bike adventure sounds like it’ll fit right in.</p>

The next great idea was that I should write about it. I’ve been in a bit of an ebb with my journalling recently. I haven’t really had the motivation to pick it up for a few months. So I thought writing about how I was preparing for this challenge (still not fully defined by the way) might be a bit of motivation. I’ve also never published my journal before, however, I’ve spent a lot of time looking for articles and guides on bikes and adventures on bikes, and the ones I’ve enjoyed the most have been the ones about people enjoying the bike they have and maybe doing it up themselves. So I think that’s what I’ll do. I want to see how far I can get with the bike I have this summer, “de-influencing” myself from feeling like I need to drop a grand on a nice road bike to have a fun adventure.</p>
